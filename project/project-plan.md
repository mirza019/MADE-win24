# Project Plan

## Title
Gun Deaths in America Analysis

## Main Question
1. What are the key demographic and circumstantial factors associated with gun deaths in America, and how do they vary by age, race, and intent?

## Description
Gun violence is a major public health issue in the United States. This project analyzes a dataset of gun-related deaths provided by FiveThirtyEight to identify trends and correlations between various factors such as age, race, intent (e.g., homicide, suicide), and location. By understanding these patterns, we can gain insights that may support prevention strategies and policy recommendations.
